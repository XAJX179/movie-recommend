      <p>Action</p>
      <p>The action film is a film genre that predominantly features chase sequences, fights, shootouts, explosions, and
        stunt work. The specifics of what constitutes an action film has been in scholarly debate since the 1980s. While
        some scholars such as David Bordwell suggested they were films that favor spectacle to storytelling, others such
        as Geoff King stated they allow the scenes of spectacle to be attuned to story telling. Action films are often
        hybrid with other genres, mixing into various forms ranging to comedies, science fiction films, and horror
        films.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Comedy</p>
      <p>The comedy film is a film genre that emphasizes humor. These films are designed to amuse audiences and make
        them laugh. Films in this genre typically have a happy ending, with dark comedy being an exception to this
        rule. Comedy is one of the oldest genres in film, and it is derived from classical comedy in theatre. Some of
        the earliest silent films were slapstick comedies, which often relied on visual depictions, such as sight gags
        and pratfalls, so they could be enjoyed without requiring sound. To provide drama and excitement to silent
        movies, live music was played in sync with the action on the screen, on pianos, organs, and other
        instruments. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films grew in popularity, as
        laughter could result from both burlesque situations but also from humorous dialogue.</p>

    <div>
      <p>Drama</p>
      <p> Drama is a category or genre of narrative fiction (or semi-fiction) intended to be more serious than humorous
        in tone. The drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular
        super-genre, macro-genre, or micro-genre, such as soap opera, police crime drama, political drama, legal
        drama, historical drama, domestic drama, teen drama, and comedy-drama (dramedy). These terms tend to indicate a
        particular setting or subject matter, or they combine a drama's otherwise serious tone with elements that
        encourage a broader range of moods. To these ends, a primary element in a drama is the occurrence of
        conflict—emotional, social, or otherwise—and its resolution in the course of the storyline.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Horror</p>
      <p>Horror is a film genre that seeks to elicit fear or disgust in its audience for entertainment purposes.

        Horror films often explore dark subject matter and may deal with transgressive topics or themes. Broad elements
        include monsters, apocalyptic events, and religious or folk beliefs.

        Horror films have existed for more than a century. Early inspirations from before the development of film
        include folklore, religious beliefs and superstitions of different cultures, and the Gothic and horror
        literature</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Romance</p>
      <p>Romance films involve romantic love stories recorded in visual media for broadcast in theatres or on television
        that focus on passion, emotion, and the affectionate romantic involvement of the main characters. Typically
        their journey through dating, courtship or marriage is featured. These films make the search for romantic love
        the main plot focus. Occasionally, romance lovers face obstacles such as finances, physical illness, various
        forms of discrimination, psychological restraints or family resistance. As in all quite strong, deep and close
        romantic relationships, the tensions of day-to-day life, temptations (of infidelity), and differences in
        compatibility enter into the plots of romantic films.</p>
